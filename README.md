**A consolidated tutorial on publishing to PyPI**, it shows how to:

- publish pure Python packages and packages that contain Python bindings of C++ source code (bound using [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)) to PyPI
- how to use the `cibuildwheel` GitHub actions to automate the wheel building and publishing process
- how to use `CMake` along with `pip` to install Python packages

The `pypi-bonjour` package gradually adds more functionality over different versions. For the tutorial and changelogs, see the [documentation site](https://bolundai0216.github.io/pypi-bonjour/). Please open an issue if anything in the tutorial is not clear.
